## **Freelance Journey in Data Science**

As a freelancer passionate about data science, my journey has always been driven by curiosity and the desire to delve into the vast sea of data. With each project, I strive not only to apply my technical knowledge but also to deeply dive into the stories that data can tell.

**Passion for Data Science**

My passion for data science is fueled by the fascination of how data, when properly interpreted, can reveal patterns, predict trends, and unravel mysteries. This field, balancing on the frontier between technical skill and creativity, allows me not just to solve complex problems but also to transform raw data into valuable insights and engaging stories.

**Collaborating on Projects**

A vital part of my freelance experience is collaborating on other people’s projects. For me, each project is a new adventure and an opportunity to learn. Working together with other professionals and clients not only expands my horizons but also allows me to make a significant contribution to the success of the projects. I firmly believe that through collaboration, we can achieve results that are much greater than the sum of individual parts.

**Featured Projects**

Below, I share some of the projects I had the pleasure to collaborate on, demonstrating my versatility and commitment to excellence in data science:

## **1. Machine Learning Optimization**

### **Convolutional Neural Network Improvement Project with CIFAR-100**

#### Overview
This project involves analyzing and enhancing an initially weak convolutional neural network, provided in the `FinalProj23.ipynb` file. The goal is to improve the network's performance within 15 training epochs, using a GPU.

#### Methodology
1. **Baseline Performance Analysis**: The initial code is run to establish a baseline for performance.
2. **Implementation and Improvements**: Modifications are made to the network architecture and training methods. The changes aim to exceed a baseline accuracy of 44% on the CIFAR-100 dataset, which contains 32x32 colored images of 100 different classes.
3. **Validation and Testing**: 10% of the dataset is reserved for validation. The project focuses on improving accuracy for both the best and worst-performing classes.

#### Techniques Used
- **Snapshot Ensemble**: Implementation of a snapshot ensemble with at least 5 snapshots to enhance classification.
- **Architecture Optimizations**: Addition or removal of layers to optimize performance for the 100 classes.

#### Results and Discussion
- **Detailed Analysis**: Detailed discussion on the strategies attempted, what worked and what didn’t, along with justification for each change made.
- **Enhanced Performance**: Report on the achieved accuracy, highlighting the accuracy of the best and worst class.

#### Contributions
- **Credits and References**: All external sources used are duly credited.

This project not only challenges technical skills in data science and machine learning but also emphasizes the importance of experimentation and critical analysis in the process of optimizing machine learning models.
